# Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1
---
# Project Overview:
This project is a really nice amalgamation of (ORA) - Offline,Responsive and Accessible components of web technology.
Here,how it achieves this:
- Service Workers for seamless offline experience.
- Media Query to make it fit all the screen sizes.
- ARIA compliant for covering all the users like those using screen readers or other accessibility devices.

# How to set up this project locally?
Download the project [here](https://github.com/Prateek-Tewari/mws-restaurant-stage-1/archive/master.zip).Open extracted folder and start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000 or py -m http.server. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install the software.
`This worked for me - python -m http.server 8000.`

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000, and it will take you to the Restaurant Reviews App Home Page.
Enjoy!!!
