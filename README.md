# Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1
---
# Project Overview:
:point_right: project is a really nice amalgamation of (ORA :heartbeat:) - Offline,Responsive and Accessible components of web technology.
Here,how it achieves this:
- Service Workers:construction_worker: for seamless offline experience.
- Media Query:grey_question: to make it fit all the screen sizes.
- ARIA compliant:earth_asia: for covering all the users like those using screen readers or other accessibility devices.

# How to set up this project locally?
Download the project [here](https://github.com/Prateek-Tewari/mws-restaurant-stage-1/archive/master.zip).Open extracted folder and start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python:snake: has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python :two:.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python :three:.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000 or py -m http.server. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install the software.
`This worked for me - python -m http.server 8000.`

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000, and it will take you to the Restaurant Reviews App Home Page.
Enjoy!!!
